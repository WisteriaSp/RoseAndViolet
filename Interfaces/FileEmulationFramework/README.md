## About The Framework

The file emulation framework is a framework for intercepting Windows API calls related to the reading of files from disk; in order to trick games into loading files that don't really exist.  

It builds on top of previous experiments with Reloaded, namely [AFS Redirector](https://github.com/Sewer56/AfsFsRedir.ReloadedII), [ONE Redirector](https://github.com/Sewer56/Heroes.Utils.OneRedirector.ReloadedII) and [Persona 4 Golden PC modloader](https://github.com/tge-was-taken/p4gpc.modloader).  


## A User Friendly Example

Replacing files inside big archives without creating new ones.

![](./docs/images/afs/afs_original_file.png)

In this case, the following files would replace the 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th file in the `SH_VOICE_E.afs` archive.  

## How it Works.

By intercepting API calls used to open files, get their properties and read from them, we can essentially create files 'on the fly'; allowing us to perform various forms of post processing such as merging archives in a way that requires zero knowledge of the application running under the hood.

In practice this is extremely effective, the original [AFS Redirector](https://github.com/Sewer56/AfsFsRedir.ReloadedII) is known for being able to work with 10+ games, including those behind emulators.

Projects using this framework are referred to as 'emulators' hence the name `File Emulation Framework`; that name is derived from the original projects which simulated nonexistent archive files.
